I can't resolve issue with closing hamburger menu in mobile mode... I think it's just a question of time, and skills in googling
And there was a issue with object date, incoming from API (the same issue as in git repo 2019->2018) I solved it with additional formula thats subtract one year from the current date. But 3 days ago you fix the issue.
